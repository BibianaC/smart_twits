SmartTwits aims to provide users with information about currently trending tweets with a view to shedding a little light on the context of the trend. It displays the top ten trending tweets on the left hand side, and upon users clicking these, provides details of:

* the most frequently occuring words within the trending tweets
* the trending tweets that have the most retweets
* the most frequently occuring mentions within the trending tweets
* the trending tweets from users with the most followers
* trending tweets that originated from media organisations
